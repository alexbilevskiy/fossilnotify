This project was created by extending an example of https://github.com/roma321m/NotificationListenerExample
  
Main goal is to count notifications on the phone and send counter to widget on the watch, as explained [here](https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/wiki/Fossil-Hybrid-HR#custom-widgets-firmware-dn1-0-2-20r-and-newer)
Currently only notifications from telegram are counted.
